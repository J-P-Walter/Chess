# Chess
Going to put this project on pause for now. My tests for getting the movement
of pieces all work great and the board get set up perfectly, however I ran into some issues when attempting
to address the logic for validating moves (ie determining if a move would put yourself
in check). Also ran into issues when attempting to make the gui for the application. 
I feel most of the issues come from a lack of preparation beforehand. 

I will probably do another attempt. I feel like I learned a lot and have some ideas
to make it better and with the new knowledge in mind, I feel confident the next 
attempt will go better.
